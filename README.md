C# Library for communication with Launchpads

This Library is mostly for easy communcation with Launchpads. 
It also implements basic Midi communication with every other device though.

The Library is the MiDI folder of the project but it also contains another Program i intend to write with it.
If you just want the MiDI library you can extract the MiDI Project from the Solution until i get around publishing dlls.
